Customization
-------------

SiteFlags allows you to customize Flags model.

1. Define your own ``flag`` model inherited from ``FlagBase``.

2. Now when ``models.py`` in your application has the definition of a custom flags model, you need
to instruct Django to use it for your project instead of a built-in one:

  .. code-block:: python

    # Somewhere in your settings.py do the following.
    # Here `myapp` is the name of your application, `MyFlag` is the names of your customized model.
    SITEFLAGS_FLAG_MODEL = 'myapp.MyFlag'


3. Run ``manage.py makemigrations`` and ``manage.py migrate`` to install your customized models into DB.
